# What is Basher?
Basher is essentially a chatting app based on **Bash**, a scripting language that is fairly easy to use as I am a begginer at programming.
Basher started as a test for a future project my friend and I have which is making an online chatting application, it is still pretty much a dream that is getting closer and closer to achieve.
Basher is still pretty simple though, as I haven't reached the main point of it, which is making 2 different computers able to share messages between eachother. (LAN)

# ""F.A.Q""
## Will this ever be online?
Listen, I'm trying my best to achieve this!

## Status

- Still in development...

Current objectives:
- Bug fixing.
- Being able to share `chat1.txt`/`chat2.txt` between two different machines to achieve LAN.
- Maybe add custom names for chatrooms?

`cd ~ && rm -rf basher && git clone https://github.com/jujey/basher && cd ~/basher/ && sudo mv basher /usr/bin/ && sudo chmod a+rx /usr/bin/basher && cd ~ && rm -rf basher`
