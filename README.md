# What is Basher?
Basher is essentially a chatting app based on **Bash**, a scripting language that is fairly easy to use as I am a begginer at programming.
Basher started as a test for a future project my friend and I have which is making an online chatting application, it is still pretty much a dream that is getting closer and closer to achieve.
Basher is still pretty simple though, as I haven't reached the main point of it, which is making 2 different computers able to share messages between eachother. (LAN)

# ""F.A.Q""
## Will this ever be online?
No I don't plan on making this online as it can be very difficult to implement since this is based on `Bash`, although I've heard of people being able to do it in the past.
I will though try to make this LAN in the future!

## How long did it take to code the first version of it?
About 2 days and it was actuallly very frustrating/enjoyable at times, (still trying to get used to programming).
I encountered a lot of bugs in the way but I fixed all of them, so I guess we're safe to say that this is the first stable version of Basher!
