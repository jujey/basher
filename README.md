# What is Basher?
Basher is essentially a chatting app based on **Bash**, a scripting language that is fairly easy to use.
Basher started as a test for a future project my friend and I have which is to make an online chatting application.
Basher is still in development, as I haven't reached a way to establish a LAN connection yet.

## Status

- In development...

Current objectives:
- Bug fixing.
- Being able to share `chat1.txt`/`chat2.txt` between two different machines.
- Custom chatroom names.
